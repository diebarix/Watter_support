## Description

dApp made by ash_ketchup team for the Side Hackathon 2023 in Guadalajara, Mexico.

Water Support aims to provide to the people of Guadalajara city with a system for checking the water consumption in their houses making use of the blockchain.
Since every transaction in the blockchain is public and inmutable, anyone could consult how much water is used in the city, thus avoiding data manipulation from anyone.
